Planning file for Project 4: 2020 Presidential Candidates

This web application is meant to be a non-partisan, informative website that details the candidates running for the 2020 Presidential Election.

While I understand that for this election, most of these candidates are primarily Democratic, I wish to not include the party of each candidate, as that holds a lot of sway when a person votes.

List of Candidates as of August 20th, 2019:
- Michael Bennet, Joe Biden, Bill de Blasio, Cory Booker, Steve Bullock, Pete Buttigieg Julian Castro, John Delaney, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Jay Inslee, Amy Klobuchar, Wayne Messam, Seth Moulton, Beto O'Rourke, Tim Ryan, Bernie Sanders, Mark Sanford, Joe Sestak, Tom Steyer, Donald Trump, Joe Walsh, Elizabeth Warren, Bill Weld, Marianne Williamson, Andrew Yang

Data to include for json file:
- name: string
- state: string
- imageUrl: string
- stillRunning: boolean
- currentTitle: string
- abortion: string or boolean...need to decide
- immigration: string or boolean
- criminalJustice: string or boolean
- minimumWage: string or boolean

idea:
- add a learn more button in the individual candidate page, and have that link to their personal website for their campaign 


Bronze Plan:
- have static website that lists candidates, shows their picture, and has different pages for their stance of different issues, and another page for an edit form

Silver Plan:
- Add more issues, and either add more css visual friendly stuff like graphs/polls, or animation
- Greyscale the pictures ==> maybe make this a part of the bronze plan actually 

Gold Plan:
- Either add graphs/polls or implement animation
- Add an 'important dates' section - which lists dates of the primary debates or dates to register to vote, etc.
- Search bar ==> can search by issue / candidate
- Maybe add more in-detph detail of a candidate's stance towards a specific issue. For now, I'm keeping it as simple as possible
